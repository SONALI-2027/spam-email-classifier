Algorithms:-
<br>
Naive bayes algorithm : used to classify email has ham or spam based on the frequency of words within it, this it identifies by getting training from data
<br>
Logistic regression algorithm : it is like a binary classification algorithm, it assigns weights to these numerical features during training, using these weights it predicts the correct label.
<br>
SVM algorithm: it is used to classify the email using a hyperplane, the svm is first trained to find a hyperplane to determine which side the new email falls on spam or ham.
